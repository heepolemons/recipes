# Project - Recipe Website
This is a website that I have created as a project. Specifically, this was an assignment from The Odin Project, a web-development education website. By completing it, I learned about the basic structure of a website. First, I learned that there needs to be an index in the root directory. Second, I have learned to put everything else, such as article pages, images, and CSS stylesheets, in their own directories.
